Distribution System Simulator
=============================

The DSS is a comprehensive electrical system simulation tool for electric
utility distribution systems.  DSS is designed to support most types of
power distribution planning analysis associated with the interconnection
of distributed generation (DG) to utility systems.  It also supports many
other types of frequency-domain circuit simulations commonly performed on
utility electric power distribution systems.  It represents unbalanced
conditions, stochastic processes, and other aspects of electrical power
distribution systems and equipment in far greater detail than many other
tools, including commercial products.
