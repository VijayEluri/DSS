Distribution System Simulator
=============================

The DSS is a comprehensive electrical system simulation tool for electric
utility distribution systems.  DSS is designed to support most types of
power distribution planning analysis associated with the interconnection
of distributed generation (DG) to utility systems.  It also supports many
other types of frequency-domain circuit simulations commonly performed on
utility electric power distribution systems.  It represents unbalanced
conditions, stochastic processes, and other aspects of electrical power
distribution systems and equipment in far greater detail than many other
tools, including commercial products.

Getting Started
---------------

The DSS shell interface can be downloaded as an archive from here:

 * https://github.com/rwl/DSS/downloads

Unpack the archive and execute either the batch file or the shell script,
dependng on your system. Type `help` at the dss prompt for a description
of each the available commands. Type `help <command>` for a more
detailed description of an individual command.

Build and Install
-----------------

The latest DSS source code may be obtained by cloning the
[GitHub](https://github.com/rwl/DSS) repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rwl/DSS.git

To build an archive of the DSS shell interface change into the source
directory and run [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/):

    $ cd DSS/
    $ mvn package

The archive is created in the `bootstrap/target/` directory. To install
the DSS modules to your local Maven repository run:

    $ mvn clean install

Project files for [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/) can be generated with
the command:

    mvn eclipse:eclipse

The projects may then be imported into Eclipse via
File->Import...->"Existing Projects into Workspace". To use
[m2e](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/), right-click on a project in the
Package Explorer view and select Configure->"Convert to Maven project".
