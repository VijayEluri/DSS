class Generator(PowerConversionElement):
    """The generator is essentially a negative load that can be dispatched.
    If the dispatch value (DispValue) is 0, the generator always follows the
    appropriate dispatch curve, which are simply load curves. If DispValue>0
    then the generator only comes on when the global circuit load multiplier
    exceeds DispValue.  When the generator is on, it always follows the
    dispatch curve appropriate for the type of solution being performed.  If
    you want to model a generator that is fully on whenever it is dispatched
    on, simply designate 'Status=Fixed'.  The default is 'Status=Variable'
    (i.e., it follows a dispatch curve.  You could also define a dispatch curve
    that is always 1.0.  Generators have their own energy meters that record:
        1. Total kwh
        2. Total kvarh
        3. Max kW
        4. Max kVA
        5. Hours in operation
        6. Price * kwH
    Generator meters reset with the circuit energy meters and take a sample
    with the circuit energy meters as well. The Energy meters also used
    trapezoidal integration so that they are compatible with Load-Duration
    simulations.  Generator models are:
        1. Constant P, Q  (* dispatch curve, if appropriate).
        2. Constant Z  (For simple solution)
        3. Constant P, |V|  like a standard power flow  [not implemented]
        4. Constant P, Fixed Q  (vars)
        5. Constant P, Fixed Q  (reactance)
    Most of the time you will use #1 for planning studies.  The default is for
    the generator to be a current injection source.  Thus, its primitive Y
    matrix contains only the impedance that might exist from the neutral of a
    wye-connected generator to ground.  However, if the generator model is
    switched to Admittance from PowerFlow (see Set Mode command), the generator
    is converted to an admittance and included in the system Y matrix.
    Generators are assumed balanced for the number of phases specified.
    If you would like unbalanced generators, enter separate single-phase
    generators.
