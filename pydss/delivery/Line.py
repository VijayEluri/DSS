class Line(PowerDeliveryElement):
    """Line impedances are specified in per unit length and are multiplied by
    the length when the primitive Y matrix is computed.  You may specify the
    impedances of the line either by symmetrical components or by R, X, and
    nodal C matrices  (also per unit length).  All C's is entered in nano
    farads.  The ultimate values are in the matrices.  If you specify matrices,
    then the symmetrical component values are ignored.  However, if you change
    any of the symmetrical component values the matrices will be recomputed.
    It is assumed you want to use symmetrical component values.  Don't mix data
    entry by matrix and by symmetrical components.  Note that if you change the
    number of phases, the matrices are reallocated and reinitialized with
    whatever is currently in the symmetrical component data.   Multi-phase,
    two-port line or cable.  Pi model.  Power delivery element described by its
    impedance.  Impedances may be specified by symmetrical component values or
    by matrix values.  Alternatively, you may simply refer to an existing
    LineCode object from which the impedance values will be copied.  Then you
    need only specify the length.  You can define the line impedance at a base
    frequency directly in a Line object definition or you can import the
    impedance definition from a LineCode object. Both of these definitions of
    impedance are quite similar except that the LineCode object can perform
    Kron reduction.  If the geometry property is specified all previous
    definitions are ignored. The DSS will compute the impedance matrices from
    the specified geometry each time the frequency changes.  Whichever
    definition is the most recent applies, as with nearly all DSS functions.
    Note the units property; you can declare any length measurement in whatever
    units you please.  Internally, everything is converted to meters. Just be
    sure to declare the units. Otherwise, they are assumed to be compatible
    with other data or irrelevant.
