        self.type = type

        #: Ratio of the PT that converts the monitored voltage to the control voltage. Default is 60.  If the capacitor is Wye, the 1st phase line-to-neutral voltage is monitored.  Else, the line-to-line voltage (1st - 2nd phase) is monitored.

        #: Value at which the control arms to switch the capacitor ON (or ratchet up a step).  Type of Control:     Current: Line Amps / CTratio     Voltage: Line-Neutral (or Line-Line for delta) Volts / PTratio     kvar:    Total kvar, all phases (3-phase for pos seq model).

This is used to determine which capacity control will act first. Default is 15.  You may specify any floating point number to achieve a model of whatever condition is necessary.

        #: Minimum voltage, in volts.  If the voltage across the capacitor divided by the PTRATIO is less than this voltage, the capacitor will switch ON regardless of other control settings. Default is 115 (goes with a PT ratio of 60 for 12.47 kV system).
