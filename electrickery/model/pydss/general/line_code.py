class LineCode:
    """ The Linecode object is a general DSS object used by all circuits
    as a reference for obtaining line impedances.

    Linecodes are objects that contain impedance characteristics for lines and
    cables.  The term "line code" is an old term that simply refers to a code
    that was made up by programmers to describe a line construction.  In most
    distribution analysis programs, one can describe a line by its linecode
    and its length.  Linecodes were defined in a separate file.  This
    collection of objects emulates the old linecode files, except that the
    concept is slightly more powerful.

    Ultimately, the impedance of a line is described by its series impedance
    matrix and nodal capacitive admittance matrix.  These matrices may be
    specified directly or they can be generated by specifying the symmetrical
    component data.  Note that the impedances of lines may be specified
    directly and one does not need to use a line code, although the linecode
    will be more convenient most of the time.  There may be hundreds of lines,
    but only a few different kinds of line constructions.

    LineCode also performs a Kron reduction, reducing out the last conductor
    in the impedance matrices, which is assumed to be a neutral conductor.
    This applies only if the impedance is specified as a matrix. If the
    impedance is defined as symmetrical components, this function does not
    apply because symmetrical component values already assume the reduction.

    By specifying the values of Rg, Xg, and rho, the DSS will take the base
    frequency impedance matrix values and adjust the earth return component
    for frequency. Skin effect in the conductors is not modified. To represent
    skin effect, you have to define the geometry.

    This assumes the impedance matrix is constructed as follows:

                 Z_{11} + Z_{g} Z_{12} + Z_{g} Z_{13} + Z_{g}

    Z = R + jX = Z_{21} + Z_{g} Z_{22} + Z_{g} Z_{23} + Z_{g}

                 Z_{31} + Z_{g} Z_{32} + Z_{g} Z_{33} + Z_{g}
