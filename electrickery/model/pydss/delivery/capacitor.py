class Capacitor(PowerDeliveryElement):
    """ Basic capacitor

    Implemented as a two-terminal constant impedance (Power Delivery Element)

    Bus2 connection defaults to 0 node of Bus1 (if Bus2 has the default bus
    connection at the time Bus1 is defined.  Therefore, if only Bus1 is
    specified, a shunt capacitor results.
    If delta connected, Bus2 is set to node zero of Bus1 and nothing is
    returned in the lower half of YPrim - all zeroes.

    If an ungrounded wye is desired, explicitly set Bus2= and set all nodes the
    same, e.g. Bus1.4.4.4   (uses 4th node of Bus1 as neutral point)
    or BusNew.1.1.1  (makes a new bus for the neutral point)
    You must specify the nodes or you will get a series capacitor!

    A series capacitor is specified simply by setting bus2 and declaring the
    connection to be Wye.  If the connection is specified as delta, nothing
    will be connected to Bus2. In fact the number of terminals is set to 1.

    Capacitance may be specified as:

     1.  kvar and kv ratings at base frequency.  impedance.  Specify kvar as total for
         all phases (all cans assumed equal). For 1-phase, kV = capacitor can kV rating.
         For 2 or 3-phase, kV is line-line three phase. For more than 3 phases, specify
         kV as actual can voltage.
     2.  Capacitance in uF to be used in each phase.  If specified in this manner,
         the given value is always used whether wye or delta.
     3.  A nodal C matrix (like a nodal admittance matrix).
         If conn=wye then 2-terminal through device
         If conn=delta then 1-terminal.
         Microfarads.
