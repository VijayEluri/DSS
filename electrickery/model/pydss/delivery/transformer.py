    """ The Transfomer model is implemented as a multi-terminal (two or more)
    power delivery element.

    A transfomer consists of two or more Windings, connected in somewhat
    arbitray fashion (with the standard Wye-Delta defaults, of course).  You
    can specify the parameters of a winding one winding at a time or use arrays
    to set all the values.  Use the "wdg=..." parameter to select a winding.

    Transformers have one or more phases.  The number of conductors per
    terminal is always one more than the number of phases.  For wye- or
    star-connected windings, the extra conductor is the neutral point.  For
    delta-connected windings, the extra terminal is open internally (you
    normally leave this connected to node 0).
