class Fault(PowerDeliveryElement):
    """ One or more faults can be placed across any two buses in the circuit.
    Like the capacitor, the second bus defaults to the ground node of the
    same bus that bus1 is connected to.

    The fault is basically an uncoupled, multiphase resistance branch. however,
    you may also specify it as NODAL CONDUCTANCE (G) matrix, which will give
    you complete control of a complex fault situation.

    To eliminate a fault from the system after it has been defined, disable it.

    In Monte Carlo Fault mode, the fault resistance is varied by the % std dev
    specified If %Stddev is specified as zero (default), the resistance is
    varied uniformly.

    Fault may have its "ON" time specified (defaults to 0). When Time (t)
    exceeds this value, the fault will be enabled.  Else it is disabled.

    Fault may be designated as Temporary.  That is, after it is enabled, it
    will disable itself if the fault current drops below the MinAmps value.
