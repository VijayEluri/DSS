class Bus(Named):
    """A bus is a circuit element having [1..N] nodes. Buses are the connection
    point for all other circuit elements. The main electrical property of a Bus
    is voltage.  Each node has a voltage with respect to the zero voltage
    reference (remote ground).  There is a nodal admittance equation written
    for every node (i.e., the current is summed at each node).  A bus may have
    any number of nodes (places to connect device terminal conductors).  The
    nodes may be arbitrarily numbered, except that the first N are reserved for
    the N phases.  Thus, if a bus has 3-phase devices connected to it,
    connections would be expected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.  So the DSS would use
    these voltages to compute the sequence voltages, for example.   Phase 1
    would nominally represent the same phase throughout the circuit, although
    that would not be mandatory.  It is up to the user to maintain a consistent
    definition.  If only the default connections are used, the consistency is
    maintained automatically. Any other nodes would simply be points of
    connection with no special meaning.  Each Bus object keeps track of the
    allocation and designation of its nodes.  Node 0 of a bus is always the
    voltage reference (a.k.a, ground, or earth). That is, it always has a
    voltage of exactly zero volts.
