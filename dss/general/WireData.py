    reference for obtaining line impedances.  This class of data defines the
    raw conductor data that is used to compute the impedance for a line
    geometry.  Note that you can use whatever units you want for any of the
    dimensional data - be sure to declare the units. Otherwise, the units are
    all assumed to match, which would be very rare for conductor data.
    Conductor data is usually supplied in a hodge-podge of units. Everything
