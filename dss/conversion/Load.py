class Load(PowerConversionElement):
    """The load is assumed balanced over the no. of phases defined.  To model
    unbalanced loads, define separate single-phase loads.  If you do not
    specify load shapes defaults are:
        Yearly:  Defaults to No variation or Daily when Daily is defined
        Daily:   Defaults to No variation  (i.e. multiplier = 1.0 always)
        Dutycycle: Defaults to Daily shape
        Growth: Circuit default growth factor
    A Load is a complicated Power Conversion element that is at the heart of
    many analyses.  It is basically defined by its nominal kW and PF or its
    kW and kvar.  Then it may be modified by a number of multipliers, including
    the global circuit load multiplier, yearly load shape, daily load shape,
    and a dutycycle load shape.  The default is for the load to be a current
    injection source.  Thus, its primitive Y matrix contains only the impedance
    that might exist from the neutral of a wye-connected load to ground.
    However, if the load model is switched to Admittance from PowerFlow (see
    Set LoadModel command), the load is converted to an admittance and included
    in the system Y matrix.  This would be the model used for fault studies
    where convergence might not be achieved because of low voltages.  Loads are
    assumed balanced for the number of phases specified.  If you would like
    unbalanced loads, enter separate single-phase loads.  There are three legal
    ways to specify the base load:
        1.kW, PF
        2.kw, kvar
        3.kVA, PF
    If you sent these properties in the order shown, the definition should
    work. If you deviate from these procedures, the result may or may not be
    what you want.  (To determine if it has accomplished the desired effect,
    execute the Dump command for the desired load(s) and observe the settings.)
